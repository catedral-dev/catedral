## The Problem

Cloud infrastructure became an unnecessary tax. Vercel charges $0.15/GB bandwidth. Bare metal costs $0.001/GB. That's **150x difference**.

Most developers pay Vercel/Railway/Render out of inertia, not technical necessity.

**Catedral is the exit.**

---

## Why Developers Choose Catedral

### 💰 Stop Paying the Cloud Tax
- One server, one price. No surprise bills, no bandwidth metering, no "contact sales"
- A $4/mo Hetzner server + $19/mo Catedral Pro replaces $150+/mo of PaaS fees
- Know exactly what you pay. Forever.

### ⚡ One Command, Not Twenty
- No YAML. No Docker Compose. No Kubernetes. No Terraform + Ansible + Nginx + Certbot
- `curl | sh` and you have infrastructure. A junior dev can deploy without being DevOps
- Deploy any app in under 60 seconds

### 🔒 Real Isolation, Not Theater
- Each app runs in its own VM with its own kernel
- One compromised app can't touch the others
- Not namespaces pretending to be secure—real boundaries

### 🔄 Break Things Fearlessly
- Atomic deployments: either fully applied or fully reverted
- Instant rollback to any previous state
- No partial updates leaving you in broken states

### 🌍 Works Everywhere
- Runs on your hardware—Hetzner, OVH, your closet server
- No vendor lock-in. Your config is portable. Your data is yours
- Works offline. Your infrastructure doesn't stop because someone else's cloud went down

### 🛡️ Security Without a PhD
- Secrets encrypted at rest. No plaintext configs
- Vulnerability scanning before deploy
- Real-time monitoring of what's actually running

---

## Who It's For

- **Indie hackers** paying $60-150/mo for things that run fine on a $4 VPS
- **LATAM & SEA developers** where $20/mo Vercel Pro is a luxury
- **DevOps freelancers** managing 5-10 client servers with scripts and prayers
- **Developers burned** by Netlify's $55 overage charges or AWS weekend surprises
- **NixOS enthusiasts** tired of hostile tooling

---

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/catedral-dev/catedral/releases/latest/download/catedral-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/catedral
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/catedral
catedral init
```

## Quick Start

```bash

## Pricing

| Plan | Apps | Price |
|------|------|-------|
| **Free** | 3 | $0 |
| **Pro** | Unlimited | $19/mo |
| **Enterprise** | Source code | Custom |

No credit card required. No surprise bills. No "contact sales" for pricing.

---

## The Anti-PaaS

Catedral is the tool we wished existed.

You shouldn't need a PhD in DevOps to deploy a web app securely. You shouldn't pay 150x markup for bandwidth. You shouldn't wake up to a $2000 AWS bill.

**Your server. Your rules. Your cathedral.**
